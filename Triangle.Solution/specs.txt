- Triangle class console app
- Console.ReadLine() to gather input from users
- Takes 3 inputs from user to determine 3 sides of Triangle
- All 3 numbers are equal => Equilateral
- Only 2 numbers are equal => Isosceles
- No numbers are equal => Scalene
- If one side > the sum of two other sides, => not a Triangle
-- e.g., 7, 4, 2: 7>6, not a triangle.
